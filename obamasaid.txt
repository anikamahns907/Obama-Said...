It also has to be reflected in our national government. The kind of leadership that\xe2\x80\x99s guided by knowledge and experience; honesty and humility; empathy and grace \xe2\x80\x93 that kind of leadership doesn\xe2\x80\x99t just belong in our state capitols and mayors offices. It belongs in the White House.\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s why I\xe2\x80\x99m so proud to endorse @JoeBiden for President of the United States.\n\nChoosing Joe to be my Vice President was one of the best decisions I ever made. He\xe2\x80\x99s got the character and the experience to guide us through one of our darkest times and heal us through a long recovery. And I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a lot more to say about why Joe should be President in the video. I hope you give it a watch.

From our medical professionals to our grocery store clerks, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen people step up and make endless sacrifices to help us get through this pandemic. Today, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be sharing the story of one of those leaders on the frontlines and my friend, @chefjoseandres. \xe2\xa0\x80\xe2\x81\xa3 \xe2\xa0\x80\xe2\x81\xa3\nThroughout this pandemic, his organization the @wckitchen has stepped up to support over 20 cities across the country. Here\xe2\x80\x99s what motivates Jose and how we all can play a role in supporting our communities: \xe2\xa0\x80\xe2\x81\xa3 \xe2\xa0\x80\xe2\x81\xa3\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are living a moment that will define generations. We will look back on these days as the world changes into something new, and we will ask ourselves\xe2\x80\xa6what did we do to help? To help the marginalized and vulnerable, to help the heroes working on the front lines, to help the huddled masses among us? \xe2\xa0\x80\xe2\x81\xa3 \xe2\xa0\x80\xe2\x81\xa3\nFrom Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico to the wildfires in California, to tornadoes and floods across the country to a humanitarian crisis on our southern border, World Central Kitchen\xe2\x80\x99s journey to serving over 15 million meals has taught us one essential lesson: instead of being paralyzed by the magnitude of a problem, we can choose to be part of the solution by coming together to just start cooking.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\xa0\x80\xe2\x81\xa3 \xe2\xa0\x80\xe2\x81\xa3\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are so, so many ways you can help. Buy a meal for the medical professionals and first responders working day and night to keep us healthy and safe. Check in on elderly neighbors to make sure they aren\xe2\x80\x99t forgotten. Wash your hands. Stay home if you can and listen to the experts, always. Being kind and caring for one another. Make sure to leave enough for the next person. Your empathy will reach beyond six feet!\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Cecilia Mu\xc3\xb1oz has been a champion for immigration and civil rights, a MacArthur Fellow recipient, and a great friend\xe2\x80\x93\xe2\x80\x93and I was proud to have her on my team as one of my senior advisors during my presidency. In her new book, More Than Ready, she shares her story and an empowering message to women, especially women of color, that they are the leaders we need to make a change in our world.'b'The Reverend Joseph Lowery was born and raised in Jim Crow Alabama with no power or privilege to speak of. But he had preaching in his blood. He had a conviction that he could join and inspire others to push for change.\nFrom those early days of the movement to his long leadership of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, he did so much to carry us ever closer to the just, fair, inclusive, and generous America promised in our founding ideals.\nReverend Lowery changed the face of America. He carried the baton longer and surer than almost anybody. It falls to the rest of us now to pick it up and never stop moving forward until we finish what he started\xe2\x80\x93that journey to justice. Michelle and I remember him fondly today, and our love and prayers are with his family and his nationwide flock.'b'In America, we all share the responsibility of looking out for one another. That\xe2\x80\x99s never more true than in times like right now. And as long as so many of us are at home, here\xe2\x80\x99s a new film that shows that responsibility in action. @CripCampFilm shares the stories of the young people who went on to lead the disability rights movement \xe2\x80\x93 young people without wealth, or power, or sometimes even respect, who came together to change this country\xe2\x80\x99s course. It\xe2\x80\x99s eye-opening, uplifting, and full of the kind of empathy for others that all of us need to summon going forward.'b"Ten years ago today, I signed the Affordable Care Act into law. It protected preexisting conditions, cut the uninsured rate in half, and lots more. But it's still under political attack right when we need care the most. We have to protect it, build on it, until we cover everyone."b'55 years ago, in Selma, Alabama, John Lewis and Amelia Boynton Robinson were two of the many civil rights organizers who were beaten for the simple act of attempting to cross the Edmund Pettus Bridge. In 2015, Michelle and I, along with Michelle\xe2\x80\x99s mother and our girls \xe2\x80\x93 three generations, hand-in-hand \xe2\x80\x93 joined these heroes to walk the path that they had paved.\nThe story of Selma is quintessentially American \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s the story of ordinary people coming together to shape our nation\xe2\x80\x99s course because they believed in the simple idea that people who love their country can change it.\nToday, the march goes on. But the way forward is a little easier, thanks to all those who came before us, who sacrificed everything for the foundation stone of democracy \xe2\x80\x93 the right to vote. Now it\xe2\x80\x99s up to us to honor their legacy by protecting and exercising that precious right, knowing that the work of perfecting our union is never done.'b'Six years ago today, we launched the My Brother\xe2\x80\x99s Keeper initiative at the White House, a call on us all to recognize that America would never live up to its potential unless our boys and young men of color could live up to theirs. We all have a stake in their success. We are all our brother\xe2\x80\x99s keeper.\nThis photo was taken at a gathering of the young people whose lives that work has touched, many of them now leaders and mentors themselves. When I entered the auditorium, I saw a room full of promising young men who deserved a nation willing to embrace them, invest in their dreams, and love them as their own.'b"If you know Chicago, you know my hometown has a thing about sports. It\xe2\x80\x99s not just about a little healthy crosstown competition, or a streak of championships in the 90s\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s that spirit of collective power that makes it possible to find hope for what's to come, even on the coldest February day.\nToday in Chicago, my friends @realmikewilbon, @giannis_an34, @kevinlove, and @cp3 joined me for a conversation about that unique power of sports to uplift a community and congregate the next generation of leaders\xe2\x80\x94and how the future Obama Presidential Center will do just that for kids on the South Side."b'Happy Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day to my forever dance partner, @MichelleObama.'b'Thirty years on, I remember the hope we all felt watching Mandela\xe2\x80\x99s release from prison.

I like this film for its nuanced, honest portrayal of the way a changing global economy plays out in real lives. It offers a window into people as they actually are and it\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of story we don\xe2\x80\x99t see often enough. This is exactly what Michelle and I hope to achieve through Higher Ground. Congratulations to the incredible filmmakers Julia Reichert and Steven Bognar, and the entire team!'b'From hip-hop to country to The Boss, here are my songs of the year.

Of course, there\xe2\x80\x99s also American Factory, a film from our own production company, Higher Ground, that was recently shortlisted for an Oscar. It\xe2\x80\x99s our first offering in partnership with Netflix, and I\xe2\x80\x99m excited about the other projects we\xe2\x80\x99ve got in the works. Here\xe2\x80\x99s the full list:'b'Over the next few days, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be sharing my annual list of favorites \xe2\x80\x94 books, films, and music \xe2\x80\x94 with all of you.

Because while each of us has plenty that keeps us busy\xe2\x80\x94work and family life, social and volunteer commitments\xe2\x80\x94outlets like literature and art can enhance our day-to-day experiences. They\xe2\x80\x99re the fabric that helps make up a life\xe2\x80\x94the album that lifts us up after a long day, the dog-eared paperback we grab off the shelf to give to a friend, the movie that makes us think and feel in a new way, works that simply help us escape for a bit. To start, here are the books that made the last year a little brighter for me. Most of them came out in 2019, but a few were older ones that were new to me this year. I hope you enjoy them as much as I did.'b'From the Obama family to yours, Merry Christmas!'b'Last week, Michelle and I had a chance to join the @ObamaFoundation Leaders for an afternoon of community service in Kuala Lumpur. Together, we built furniture for local schools in need of some refurbishing. It was inspiring to see these emerging young leaders so motivated to help those in need\xe2\x80\x94and a reminder that Michelle is much better with power tools than I am.'b"Growing up in Indonesia and Hawaii instilled in me a sense of cooperation and community. It was meaningful to return to the region with my little sister Maya and spend time with hundreds of emerging @ObamaFoundation leaders from across the Asia Pacific. My message to them was simple: Rejoice in this opportunity to change the world. If we stick with it, even if we can't always see it ourselves, we will change the world for the better."b'I thought it was about time I share my holiday gift list \xe2\x80\x94 a few practical, affordable items, all for $10 or less. But the best one is no joke: Health care for you or somebody you care about. This year, most current HealthCare.gov customers can find an insurance plan with a monthly premium of $10 or less. The deadline to sign up is December 15, so head to HealthCare.gov and get covered.'b'Today, we give thanks for our blessings, give back to those around us, and enjoy some time \xe2\x80\x94 and turkey, and maybe a little football \xe2\x80\x94 with the ones we love. From the Obama family to yours, Happy Thanksgiving.'b'Last night, I had the chance to sit down with Stacey Abrams to talk about how Democrats can win up and down the ballot in 2020. There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of great work already happening: Stacey\xe2\x80\x99s Fair Fight effort to end voter suppression, Eric Holder\xe2\x80\x99s National Democratic Redistricting Committee to draw fair maps, and a lot of big-hearted, forward-looking candidates and campaigns to get people registered and out to the polls.\xe2\x81\xa3\n\xe2\x81\xa3\nThe truth is we win when people vote. The more energized we are, the better organized we are as a party, the better the outcome. We believe in the ideals of equality and democracy, freedom of thought and religion. We rally around the notion that we are all bound together and a belief that civil argument can lead us to a more perfect union. We commit ourselves to the principles that are embodied in our Constitution. And we have to remember that our faith is tested at hard times, not at easy times. That\xe2\x80\x99s how this works. So I hope all of us\xe2\x80\x94as citizens, as volunteers, as Americans who simply believe that we can make this country better\xe2\x80\x94are ready to get marching, get organizing, and get voting. It\xe2\x80\x99s up to us.'b"No one says it better than @MichelleObama \xe2\x80\x94 the Obama Presidential Center coming to the South Side isn't for us, it's for the community and the next generation of leaders."b'Every time I leave Chicago, I leave with a little more hope. Over the years, I\xe2\x80\x99ve made some pretty remarkable memories here, and today we added one more at the @ObamaFoundation Summit.

It was there that I found my community and my purpose. Excited to be back here for the @ObamaFoundation Summit to hear some remarkable stories from folks around the world\xe2\x80\x94and share my own. I hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll tune in at obama.org'b'Samantha Power is a Pulitzer Prize winner, an incredible writer, and a great friend. And from my campaign through all eight years of my presidency, she was a key voice on my foreign policy team. In her highly personal and reflective memoir, The Education of an Idealist, she grapples with the balance between idealism, pragmatism, advocacy and governance. It\xe2\x80\x99s a must-read for anyone who cares about our role in a changing world.'b'The Pacific has always been a part of me. Growing up in Hawai\xca\xbbi and Indonesia, with the guidance of my mother and grandparents, I learned to appreciate the wonders and beauty of the region. During my time in elected office and in the years since, I saw the many ways that the Asia-Pacific region has positioned itself to take advantage of tremendous opportunities. It\xe2\x80\x99s home to a remarkable generation of emerging leaders, women and men poised to take on some of the greatest challenges our planet has ever faced. Earlier this year, I had a chance to meet with a few of these folks as we designed the @ObamaFoundation Leaders: Asia-Pacific program. And today, I\xe2\x80\x99m excited to say that Michelle and I will be joining the program\xe2\x80\x99s inaugural gathering in Malaysia in December. We\xe2\x80\x99ll talk about the importance of ethical leadership\xe2\x80\x94how staying true to your values is the only way to truly carry out lasting change.

In her memoir, Tough Love, you\xe2\x80\x99ll see why. It\xe2\x80\x99s a tribute to American leadership\xe2\x80\x94and a unifying call for us to do our part to protect it. I hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll read it.'b'Like the Beatles said: It\xe2\x80\x99s getting better all the time. Thanks, babe, for 27 amazing years!'b'Meet William Lucas from Durham, North Carolina. He answered the call when @allontheline asked engaged citizens to come to the state capitol and share their opinions about the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s court-mandated redraw.

Her age might have something to do with it. With full knowledge that her generation will bear the heaviest burden of climate change, she\xe2\x80\x99s unafraid to believe that progress is possible\xe2\x80\x94and fight for real change. She\xe2\x80\x99s an example of why Michelle and I started the @ObamaFoundation \xe2\x80\x94 because we believe in a future that\xe2\x80\x99s shaped by the courage and hope of young people like Greta.'b'Training is at the heart of organizing. It\xe2\x80\x99s why I\xe2\x80\x99ve always made it a priority \xe2\x80\x93 from my 2008 campaign until now.

Hope you enjoy.'b'A good story helps us see the world outside of ourselves. It can help us feel a sort of solidarity with each other. And it\xe2\x80\x99s one of our biggest goals with the stories we\xe2\x80\x99re going to tell with Higher Ground. Part of this project is trying to make the world a little bit better for all our children and grandchildren. Because if we can put some better stories out there and make sure were hearing each other, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to see a generation that is more tolerant, more inclusive, and better equipped to take on the challenges we face. Higher Ground\xe2\x80\x99s first film, American Factory, is a complicated story with no easy solutions. But to me, it shows the value in recognizing someone else\xe2\x80\x99s perspective. So take a look at our conversation with the directors, and check out American Factory on Netflix.'b"It's August, so I wanted to let you know about a few books I've been reading this summer, in case you're looking for some suggestions. To start, you can't go wrong by reading or re-reading the collected works of Toni Morrison. Beloved, Song of Solomon, The Bluest Eye, Sula, everything else \xe2\x80\x94 they're transcendent, all of them. You\xe2\x80\x99ll be glad you read them. And while I\xe2\x80\x99m at it, here are a few more titles you might want to explore."b'Some things change \xe2\x80\x94 like my taste in khakis and polo shirts \xe2\x80\x94 but Bud Billiken endures. For 90 years, the Bud Billiken parade has brought people together to celebrate the rich history and culture of Chicago\xe2\x80\x99s South Side. I am proud the @ObamaFoundation team is out there representing our next chapter today as we work to bring the Obama Presidential Center to life and empower the next generation of leaders.'b'Time is no match for Toni Morrison. In her writing, she sometimes toyed with it, warping and creasing it, bending it to her masterful will. In her life\xe2\x80\x99s story, too, she treated time nontraditionally. A child of the Great Migration who\xe2\x80\x99d lifted up new, more diverse voices in American literature as an editor, Toni didn\xe2\x80\x99t publish her first novel until she was 39 years old. From there followed an ascendant career\xe2\x80\x94a Pulitzer, a Nobel, and so much more\xe2\x80\x94and with it, a fusion of the African American story within the American story. Toni Morrison was a national treasure. Her writing was not just beautiful but meaningful\xe2\x80\x94a challenge to our conscience and a call to greater empathy. She was as good a storyteller, as captivating, in person as she was on the page. And so even as Michelle and I mourn her loss and send our warmest sympathies to her family and friends, we know that her stories\xe2\x80\x94that our stories\xe2\x80\x94will always be with us, and with those who come after, and on and on, for all time.'b'Recent court decisions make it clear that the change we need to restore our democracy has to come from the ground up. @Allontheline\xe2\x80\x99s work to ensure a fair and accurate census count and achieve fair maps in 2021 has never been more important. Join us today at the link in my bio.'b"Over the years, you've probably seen Michelle's mom, Marian Robinson, in photos with our family at inaugurations, Christmas tree lightings, Easter Egg Rolls, and a whole lot more. But what you haven't seen is the way she's been there for us every day\xe2\x80\x94not just for Michelle and our daughters, but for me, too. I've always appreciated her steadiness, her perspective, and the way a wisecrack from her reverberates around the room. Happy birthday, Marian\xe2\x80\x94here's to many more."b'#MandelaDay reminds us that when things feel dark, confusing, or impossible\xe2\x80\x94take a look back at his writings.

In 2016, I was proud to designate it as our first national monument to tell the story of the struggle for LGBT rights. Stonewall reminds us the arc of our history is an arc of progress so long as we keep pushing for it.'b'Outside the Oval Office, I kept a painting of a small crowd huddled around a pocketwatch, waiting for the moment the Emancipation Proclamation took effect. On Juneteenth, we celebrate the anniversary of that news - freedom - reaching slaves in Texas.
