It also has to be reflected in our national government. The kind of leadership that\xe2\x80\x99s guided by knowledge and experience; honesty and humility; empathy and grace \xe2\x80\x93 that kind of leadership doesn\xe2\x80\x99t just belong in our state capitols and mayors offices. It belongs in the White House.\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s why I\xe2\x80\x99m so proud to endorse @JoeBiden for President of the United States.\n\nChoosing Joe to be my Vice President was one of the best decisions I ever made. He\xe2\x80\x99s got the character and the experience to guide us through one of our darkest times and heal us through a long recovery. And I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a lot more to say about why Joe should be President in the video. I hope you give it a watch.

From our medical professionals to our grocery store clerks, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen people step up and make endless sacrifices to help us get through this pandemic. Today, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be sharing the story of one of those leaders on the frontlines and my friend, @chefjoseandres. \xe2\xa0\x80\xe2\x81\xa3 \xe2\xa0\x80\xe2\x81\xa3\nThroughout this pandemic, his organization the @wckitchen has stepped up to support over 20 cities across the country.

We will look back on these days as the world changes into something new, and we will ask ourselves\xe2\x80\xa6what did we do to help? To help the marginalized and vulnerable, to help the heroes working on the front lines, to help the huddled masses among us? \xe2\xa0\x80\xe2\x81\xa3 \xe2\xa0\x80\xe2\x81\xa3\nFrom Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico to the wildfires in California, to tornadoes and floods across the country to a humanitarian crisis on our southern border, World Central Kitchen\xe2\x80\x99s journey to serving over 15 million meals has taught us one essential lesson: instead of being paralyzed by the magnitude of a problem, we can choose to be part of the solution by coming together to just start cooking.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\xa0\x80\xe2\x81\xa3 \xe2\xa0\x80\xe2\x81\xa3\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are so, so many ways you can help.

Wash your hands. Stay home if you can and listen to the experts, always. Being kind and caring for one another. Make sure to leave enough for the next person.

In her new book, More Than Ready, she shares her story and an empowering message to women, especially women of color, that they are the leaders we need to make a change in our world.'b'The Reverend Joseph Lowery was born and raised in Jim Crow Alabama with no power or privilege to speak of. But he had preaching in his blood. He had a conviction that he could join and inspire others to push for change.\nFrom those early days of the movement to his long leadership of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, he did so much to carry us ever closer to the just, fair, inclusive, and generous America promised in our founding ideals.\nReverend Lowery changed the face of America. He carried the baton longer and surer than almost anybody. It falls to the rest of us now to pick it up and never stop moving forward until we finish what he started\xe2\x80\x93that journey to justice. Michelle and I remember him fondly today, and our love and prayers are with his family and his nationwide flock.'b'In America, we all share the responsibility of looking out for one another. That\xe2\x80\x99s never more true than in times like right now. And as long as so many of us are at home, here\xe2\x80\x99s a new film that shows that responsibility in action. @CripCampFilm shares the stories of the young people who went on to lead the disability rights movement \xe2\x80\x93 young people without wealth, or power, or sometimes even respect, who came together to change this country\xe2\x80\x99s course. It\xe2\x80\x99s eye-opening, uplifting, and full of the kind of empathy for others that all of us need to summon going forward.'b"Ten years ago today, I signed the Affordable Care Act into law. It protected preexisting conditions, cut the uninsured rate in half, and lots more. But it's still under political attack right when we need care the most.

But the way forward is a little easier, thanks to all those who came before us, who sacrificed everything for the foundation stone of democracy \xe2\x80\x93 the right to vote.

Of course, there\xe2\x80\x99s also American Factory, a film from our own production company, Higher Ground, that was recently shortlisted for an Oscar. It\xe2\x80\x99s our first offering in partnership with Netflix, and I\xe2\x80\x99m excited about the other projects we\xe2\x80\x99ve got in the works.

Because while each of us has plenty that keeps us busy\xe2\x80\x94work and family life, social and volunteer commitments\xe2\x80\x94outlets like literature and art can enhance our day-to-day experiences. They\xe2\x80\x99re the fabric that helps make up a life\xe2\x80\x94the album that lifts us up after a long day, the dog-eared paperback we grab off the shelf to give to a friend, the movie that makes us think and feel in a new way, works that simply help us escape for a bit. To start, here are the books that made the last year a little brighter for me. Most of them came out in 2019, but a few were older ones that were new to me this year. I hope you enjoy them as much as I did.'b'From the Obama family to yours, Merry Christmas!'b'Last week, Michelle and I had a chance to join the @ObamaFoundation Leaders for an afternoon of community service in Kuala Lumpur.

It was meaningful to return to the region with my little sister Maya and spend time with hundreds of emerging @ObamaFoundation leaders from across the Asia Pacific. My message to them was simple: Rejoice in this opportunity to change the world. If we stick with it, even if we can't always see it ourselves, we will change the world for the better."b'I thought it was about time I share my holiday gift list \xe2\x80\x94 a few practical, affordable items, all for $10 or less. But the best one is no joke: Health care for you or somebody you care about. This year, most current HealthCare.gov customers can find an insurance plan with a monthly premium of $10 or less. The deadline to sign up is December 15, so head to HealthCare.gov and get covered.'b'Today, we give thanks for our blessings, give back to those around us, and enjoy some time \xe2\x80\x94 and turkey, and maybe a little football \xe2\x80\x94 with the ones we love.

The more energized we are, the better organized we are as a party, the better the outcome. We believe in the ideals of equality and democracy, freedom of thought and religion. We rally around the notion that we are all bound together and a belief that civil argument can lead us to a more perfect union. We commit ourselves to the principles that are embodied in our Constitution. And we have to remember that our faith is tested at hard times, not at easy times. That\xe2\x80\x99s how this works. So I hope all of us\xe2\x80\x94as citizens, as volunteers, as Americans who simply believe that we can make this country better\xe2\x80\x94are ready to get marching, get organizing, and get voting.

Over the years, I\xe2\x80\x99ve made some pretty remarkable memories here, and today we added one more at the @ObamaFoundation Summit.

And from my campaign through all eight years of my presidency, she was a key voice on my foreign policy team.

It\xe2\x80\x99s a must-read for anyone who cares about our role in a changing world.'b'The Pacific has always been a part of me. Growing up in Hawai\xca\xbbi and Indonesia, with the guidance of my mother and grandparents, I learned to appreciate the wonders and beauty of the region. During my time in elected office and in the years since, I saw the many ways that the Asia-Pacific region has positioned itself to take advantage of tremendous opportunities. It\xe2\x80\x99s home to a remarkable generation of emerging leaders, women and men poised to take on some of the greatest challenges our planet has ever faced. Earlier this year, I had a chance to meet with a few of these folks as we designed the @ObamaFoundation Leaders: Asia-Pacific program. And today, I\xe2\x80\x99m excited to say that Michelle and I will be joining the program\xe2\x80\x99s inaugural gathering in Malaysia in December. We\xe2\x80\x99ll talk about the importance of ethical leadership\xe2\x80\x94how staying true to your values is the only way to truly carry out lasting change.

He answered the call when @allontheline asked engaged citizens to come to the state capitol and share their opinions about the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s court-mandated redraw.

She\xe2\x80\x99s an example of why Michelle and I started the @ObamaFoundation \xe2\x80\x94 because we believe in a future that\xe2\x80\x99s shaped by the courage and hope of young people like Greta.'b'Training is at the heart of organizing.

And it\xe2\x80\x99s one of our biggest goals with the stories we\xe2\x80\x99re going to tell with Higher Ground. Part of this project is trying to make the world a little bit better for all our children and grandchildren. Because if we can put some better stories out there and make sure were hearing each other, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to see a generation that is more tolerant, more inclusive, and better equipped to take on the challenges we face. Higher Ground\xe2\x80\x99s first film, American Factory, is a complicated story with no easy solutions. But to me, it shows the value in recognizing someone else\xe2\x80\x99s perspective. So take a look at our conversation with the directors, and check out American Factory on Netflix.'b"It's August, so I wanted to let you know about a few books I've been reading this summer, in case you're looking for some suggestions. To start, you can't go wrong by reading or re-reading the collected works of Toni Morrison. Beloved, Song of Solomon, The Bluest Eye, Sula, everything else \xe2\x80\x94 they're transcendent, all of them. You\xe2\x80\x99ll be glad you read them.

I am proud the @ObamaFoundation team is out there representing our next chapter today as we work to bring the Obama Presidential Center to life and empower the next generation of leaders.'b'Time is no match for Toni Morrison. In her writing, she sometimes toyed with it, warping and creasing it, bending it to her masterful will. In her life\xe2\x80\x99s story, too, she treated time nontraditionally. A child of the Great Migration who\xe2\x80\x99d lifted up new, more diverse voices in American literature as an editor, Toni didn\xe2\x80\x99t publish her first novel until she was 39 years old. From there followed an ascendant career\xe2\x80\x94a Pulitzer, a Nobel, and so much more\xe2\x80\x94and with it, a fusion of the African American story within the American story. Toni Morrison was a national treasure. Her writing was not just beautiful but meaningful\xe2\x80\x94a challenge to our conscience and a call to greater empathy. She was as good a storyteller, as captivating, in person as she was on the page. And so even as Michelle and I mourn her loss and send our warmest sympathies to her family and friends, we know that her stories\xe2\x80\x94that our stories\xe2\x80\x94will always be with us, and with those who come after, and on and on, for all time.'b'Recent court decisions make it clear that the change we need to restore our democracy has to come from the ground up. @Allontheline\xe2\x80\x99s work to ensure a fair and accurate census count and achieve fair maps in 2021 has never been more important. Join us today at the link in my bio.'b"Over the years, you've probably seen Michelle's mom, Marian Robinson, in photos with our family at inaugurations, Christmas tree lightings, Easter Egg Rolls, and a whole lot more. But what you haven't seen is the way she's been there for us every day\xe2\x80\x94not just for Michelle and our daughters, but for me, too.

In 2016, I was proud to designate it as our first national monument to tell the story of the struggle for LGBT rights. Stonewall reminds us the arc of our history is an arc of progress so long as we keep pushing for it.'b'Outside the Oval Office, I kept a painting of a small crowd huddled around a pocketwatch, waiting for the moment the Emancipation Proclamation took effect. On Juneteenth, we celebrate the anniversary of that news - freedom - reaching slaves in Texas.

I\xe2\x80\x99m also thinking about my grandfather. Though Gramps arrived at Omaha Beach weeks after D-Day, I remember how much I missed him during my visit five years ago \xe2\x80\x93 I wanted to have him right there with me, to hear his stories, to share the experience. But I was lucky to spend time with \xe2\x80\x9cRock\xe2\x80\x9d Merritt who, as a younger man, saw a recruitment poster asking him if he was man enough to be a paratrooper \xe2\x80\x94 and signed up on the spot.

Five years ago today, at Omaha Beach \xe2\x80\x93 democracy\xe2\x80\x99s beachhead \xe2\x80\x93 I spoke about the debt we owe Rock and his fellow veterans who risked and gave their lives in defense of democracy."b"On Friday, I had a chance to meet with some inspiring young leaders from around the world who were in Ottawa last week for the Open Government Partnership Global Summit.

It's inspiring\xe2\x80\x94the kind of thing that will create a better world for all of us."b"Exciting to see the faces of Colombia's future at an @ObamaFoundation roundtable with young leaders in Bogot\xc3\xa1.

The photos are grainy now, dusty artifacts from another era. It was a different world then, we can tell ourselves\xe2\x80\x94another place, another time.\nFully grappling with the reality of the Holocaust, though, isn\xe2\x80\x99t so simple. Because before the camps and the brownshirts, before the consolidation of political power, before millions of lives were extinguished, there were simply people, not altogether different from any of us, who chose to see their neighbors as different, as other, as something less.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s a sadly familiar choice, one that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen generation after generation. And today, in our world of encroaching division and calcifying bubbles, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen once again the swiftness with which that choice\xe2\x80\x94that failure to recognize ourselves in one another\xe2\x80\x94can accelerate into violence.\nSo it\xe2\x80\x99s up to us to make a different choice\xe2\x80\x94to choose empathy over apathy; to sow seeds of hope rather than hate; to embrace our shared humanity, no matter how we worship, what we look like, who we love, or where our families came from.\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s how we can not only pause to remember a tragedy once a year, but act on the lessons we\xe2\x80\x99ve learned from it every day.'b"Today, we welcome the next 20 civic leaders as @ObamaFoundation Fellows.

As we confront division, discrimination, inequality in our own time\xe2\x80\x94challenges too big for one person and too complex for one simple solution\xe2\x80\x94it's easy to get discouraged. I find that it's best then, as it often is, to remind ourselves of the words of a political prisoner who rose to lead a nation and inspire the world.

I am My Brother\xe2\x80\x99s Keeper. \xe2\x80\x9cMy hope for all boys and young men of color is peace. I hope for a brighter future where these young men won\xe2\x80\x99t be fearful of applying for a job or chasing an opportunity because of their skin color. Too often I hear my peers talk about how they have to go about things a certain way or there are certain jobs they simply cannot do. \xe2\x80\x9cI just want to grow. I want to expand. #MBKRising gives us a chance to come together as a community and have the conversations that can only come from a diversity of perspectives. I am only one person with one set of experiences. There\xe2\x80\x99s a limit to what I know. The only way I\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to grow and learn is to interact with the community of leaders who are working hard to help boys and young men of color like me achieve their dreams.

He\xe2\x80\x99s a young man I got to know when he was a White House mentee in 2014, and he\xe2\x80\x99s one of the hundreds of people coming to Oakland this week for MBK Rising!, a nationwide gathering of community members and partners that represent the My Brother\xe2\x80\x99s Keeper movement. We\xe2\x80\x99re bringing these groups together to celebrate five years of progress on behalf of boys and young men of color\xe2\x80\x94and to set our sights on the road ahead.\nSince we started My Brother\xe2\x80\x99s Keeper five years ago, one of the things we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen consistently is the power of mentoring as a tool to help young people address the challenges they face and see the opportunities in front of them. Mentoring just works.\nToday, I\xe2\x80\x99m turning my Instagram account over to Jerron to tell you a little about his experience with mentorship. His story shows us what\xe2\x80\x99s possible when we invest in our young people and show them we believe in their promise. It\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of story we should hear more often\xe2\x80\x94the kind we\xe2\x80\x99ll hear a lot of in Oakland this week. It\xe2\x80\x99s the kind story that gives me hope. \xe2\x80\x9cAt the beginning of high school, I felt like I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t operating with purpose. I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t helping anyone. I was selected to be a member of my principal\xe2\x80\x99s student leadership team and I thought \xe2\x80\x98Why me? I don\xe2\x80\x99t see myself like this.\xe2\x80\x99 But in senior year, I found AMATE\xe2\x80\x94African American Males Aspiring to Excel\xe2\x80\x94a mentoring program for young men of color. What was so powerful to me about the group was the vulnerability. As guys, we were used to not talking about our problems. We bottled it all up and called it pride. So to be in this group of young men, sharing their feelings and being vulnerable with each other, was life-changing for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Jerron Hawkins, 21, participant at #MBKRising, Washington D.C. (1/3)'b'Five years ago, I launched the My Brother\xe2\x80\x99s Keeper initiative calling on all Americans to take action on behalf our nation\xe2\x80\x99s boys and young men of color. It was a call to make sure every child felt valued, safe, and supported by their community\xe2\x80\x94a call to help these young men in particular see hope and opportunity in their future.\n\nWe\xe2\x80\x99ve come a long way in those five years. Today, as part of the @ObamaFoundation, the @MBK_Alliance consists of nearly 250 communities working to break down barriers that too often leave boys and young men of color at a disadvantage. And tomorrow in Oakland, I\xe2\x80\x99ll join the My Brother\xe2\x80\x99s Keeper community to mark the progress we\xe2\x80\x99ve made and chart the course ahead at a celebration we\xe2\x80\x99re calling MBK Rising!\n\nIn the lead-up to the event, and in honor of Black History Month, I wanted to share a nonfiction reading list that can help to provide some essential context about the challenges that many people of color face every day. From modern memoirs to cornerstones of the American narrative, these works can help us better understand our country\xe2\x80\x99s past and our evolving, persistent struggles with race\xe2\x80\x94and they can be fuel on our journey toward a more fair and just future for all of our sons and daughters. They certainly are for me.\n\nI hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll take some time to read some of these books, letters, and articles.

I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t running for office. I was running a voter-registration drive in Chicago. What I learned then -- and what would become the premise of my 2008 campaign -- was that you couldn't just fight for existing votes. You had to reach out to all of these people who had lost faith and lost trust, and get them off the sidelines.\n\nSo during our first campaign, when I started seeing all these stories about record turnout in communities all over the country -- from young people in line for hours in Iowa to elderly folks in lawn chairs down in Florida -- I knew that we had shown what is possible when everybody decides to participate. And that, in and of itself, gave people a sense of their own power -- their own agency in the kind of country we want to leave for our kids. When more people get off the sidelines and decide to participate, our country becomes a little more representative of its people -- of everyone's collective decision. And American politics can change as a result.\n\nSo on Election Day this Tuesday, I\xe2\x80\x99m not just asking you to vote. I'm asking you to really show up once again. Talk with your friends, convince some new voters, and get them out to vote because then something powerful happens. Change happens. Hope happens. And with each new step we take in the direction of fairness, and justice, and equality, and opportunity, hope spreads."b"Not sure who and what you can vote for?\nVote Save America put together a guide to help make sure you walk into the voting booth knowing where you stand on the candidates and initiatives you'll be voting on. Here's how it works: Enter your address, and you'll learn everything you need to know about who's running to represent you, which measures you have the opportunity to help decide, and more. Now, these ballot initiatives are really important. They allow millions of Americans to make decisions about real, concrete issues in their communities -- things like how hard it is to get an assault weapon, who gets tax breaks and why, how we care for our veterans, and what the requirements ought to be for casting a ballot. (That's right -- this election year, millions of Americans can cast a vote to help more Americans cast a vote.) And when you consider the fact that these initiatives tend to be written in a confusing way to begin with, it makes even more to sense to read up and make an informed decision now.\nHere's the bottom line: The only thing more important than being a voter is being the most informed voter out there. So make sure November 6 isn't the first time you're seeing your ballot. Go to votesaveamerica.com/ballot right now, and let's get this thing done."b"Your vote can decide the health care of millions.

You need to vote, because our democracy depends on it.\n\nThe biggest threat to our democracy doesn't come from any one person. The biggest threat to our democracy is indifference. The biggest threat to our democracy is cynicism \xe2\x80\x93 a cynicism that\xe2\x80\x99s led too many people to turn away from politics, and to stay home on Election Day.\n\nThe antidote to government by the powerful few is democracy by the organized many.\n\nIf you get involved, and engaged, and knock on some doors, and talk with your friends, and argue with your family members, and change some minds, and vote \xe2\x80\x93 then something powerful happens. Change happens. Hope happens. With each new candidate that surprises you with a victory, a spark of hope happens. With each new law that helps a kid read, or a poor family find shelter, or a veteran get the support he or she has earned, hope happens. With each new step we take in the direction of fairness, and justice, and equality, and opportunity, hope spreads.\n\nI believe that can be the legacy of your generation. You can be the generation that stood up and reminded us just how precious democracy is, and just how powerful it can be when we fight for it. I believe you will. Because I believe in you.

I just got whooped. I had been in the state legislature for a long time, I was in the minority party, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t getting a lot done, and I was away from my family and putting a lot of strain on Michelle. Then for me to run and lose that bad, I was thinking maybe this isn\xe2\x80\x99t what I was cut out to do. I was forty years old, and I\xe2\x80\x99d invested a lot of time and effort into something that didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be working. But the thing that got me through that moment, and any other time that I\xe2\x80\x99ve felt stuck, is to remind myself that it\xe2\x80\x99s about the work. Because if you\xe2\x80\x99re worrying about yourself\xe2\x80\x94if you\xe2\x80\x99re thinking: \xe2\x80\x98Am I succeeding? Am I in the right position?
